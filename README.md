# Football-Recommendation-System
With this project, you can find the most statistically similar footballer to your favourite football star playing in the top 5 European leagues.

The data is scraped from FBref.com(https://fbref.com/en/comps/Big5/stats/players/Big-5-European-Leagues-Stats) along with advanced player statistics available there itself.
The project uses cosine similarity algorithm and kNN algorithm to find the most similar players and visualises the findings using a spider chart. 
The project can be extended later to add advanced ML algorithms, add GUI, make better filtering based on age/nationality/league,add more league data.
